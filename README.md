# Basic PortScanner

By RhysRead 09/02/2019

## Context:
I found myself in a situation recently where I needed to conduct a port scan on a host but for some reason my
Nmap was not working. I have since resolved the Nmap issue, but found this fairly lightweight scanner to be useful
as a backup kept on a USB. It uses only Python 3 builtins and no other libraries.

### Usage:
Run the main.py file located in ~/Basic-PortScanner/src.
